# React-NodeJs-Counter-App

Build a react app with nodejs backend. The app should have a real time counter, i.e. there should be a button and a number on the page which gets incremented when the button is clicked.

The app can be opened in multiple tabs and all of them should update the counter to the same number when the button is clicked on any tab. 

The counter should be implemented on the backend, with two APIs, one for incrementing the count and another one for retrieving the current count.
